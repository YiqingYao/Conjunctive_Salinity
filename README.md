Brief introduction:
1) "howitt_1995_PMP.pdf" describes the theory of PMP method calibration. 
2) "Ag Modeling Examples_Rev2.pdf" is a simplified 3-step tutorial of how to derive the PMP parameters. 
3) "SWAP_TechAppendix_080612_Draft.pdf" provides the data used to derive the PMP parameters in the model. 
4) "total_SWAP.xlsx" records the procedure deriving the PMP parameters in the model. 
5) "Paper2_Model.xlsx" is the model coupled with sensitivity analysis part of the paper.
6) "Paper 2 plot.xlsx" contains the model result with plots for discussion.
